# KSSProjekt
Repository for the project of Complex Software  at University of Applied Science Salzburg

It is a simple webserver written in JavaScript using Node.js. The server generates random numbers and sends each time it generated a number to all connected clients via Socket.io.

Before you start this project you have to install the NPM packages:

```
    npm install
```

After the packages were installed successfully you can start the server via:

```
    node server.js
```

The server will start and listen to port 3000.

This little project was made by Fabio Batz, Andreas Frank and Christian Lehner.
